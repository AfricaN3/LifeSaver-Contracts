## Features

- Regular token transfers are disallowed.
- Each NFT will belong to an epoch. Every blood drive event starts a new epoch.
- Only epoch admin (blood drive partner) can mint NFT to an address.
- An epoch can only start when 50 $NEO (this will be an adjustable parameter) is deposited to the contract (minimum raffle reward pool).
- The number of raffle winners will be set by the epoch admin.
- Special token transfers called "rescues" are allowed for ~1 hour when the NFT owner can provide proof to - the epoch admin that both the “from” and “to” wallet belong to them.
- Only allows a maximum balance of one per epoch for every address.
