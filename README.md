<h1 align="center">LifeSaver NFTs</h1>

<p align="center">
  The NFTs are Soulbound tokens of the NEP-11 standard given to blood donors. 
  <br/> Made with ‚ù§ by <b>AfricaN3.com</b>
</p>

## Features

- Regular token transfers are disallowed.
- Each NFT will belong to an `era`. Every blood drive event starts a new `era`.
- Only `era` admin (blood drive partner) can mint NFT to an address.
- An `era` can only start when 50 $NEO (this will be an adjustable parameter) is deposited to the contract (minimum raffle reward pool).
- The number of raffle winners will be set by the `era` admin.
- Special token transfers called `rescues` are allowed for ~1 hour when the NFT owner can provide proof to the `era` admin that both the `from` and `to` wallet belong to them.
- Only allows a maximum balance of one per `era` for every address.
